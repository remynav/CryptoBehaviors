# CryptoBehaviors

1. If SoupCoin is minted at 11:11 am/pm, then mint 5 times the amount to the user
2. If trying to burn more than 1000 SoupCoin, burn all the user's SoupCoin
3. Randomly every week, there will be a user chosen who has recently transfered SoupCoin who will be transfered 10 SoupCoin from my account
